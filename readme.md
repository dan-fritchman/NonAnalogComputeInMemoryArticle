# Non-Analog CIM Article

Off-shoot from https://github.com/dan-fritchman/NonAnalogComputeInMemory 
(because Overleaf likes its own repo, I guess).  

Readable for humans in Markdown via [article.md](./article.md)  
Or for nerds in two-column Latex via [article.pdf](./gen/article.pdf) (coming soon)
