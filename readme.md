# Non-Analog CIM Article

Off-shoot from https://github.com/dan-fritchman/NonAnalogComputeInMemory.  
(Because Overleaf likes its own repo, I guess).  

Readable for humans in Markdown via [article.md](./article.md)  
Or for nerds in two-column [Latex-PDF](./gen/NonAnalogComputeInMemoryArticle.pdf)
